# brainf_ck
is my [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-brainfuck) implementation with a compiler and VM for the esoteric language brainfuck 

## what is branfuck?

Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that was created by Urban Müller in 1993. Apparently the intention was to be able to create a language that allowed for the creation of a tiny compiler. The first compiler being just 296 bytes, which later shrank to 240 bytes. There’s now one that is around 170 bytes
